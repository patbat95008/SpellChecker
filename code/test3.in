                Eye halve a spelling chequer

                It plainly marques four my revue
                Miss steaks eye kin knot sea

                Eye strike a quay and type a word
                And weight four it two say
                Weather eye am wrong oar rite
                It shows me strait a weigh

                As soon as a mist ache is maid
                It nose bee fore two long
                And eye can put the error rite
                Its rare lea ever wrong

                Eye have run this poem threw it
                Eye am shore your pleased two no
                Its letter perfect all the weigh
                My chequer tolled me sew.
